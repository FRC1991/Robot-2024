# FRC Team 1991 The Dragons - 2024 Robot Code base

You can find a complete guide to both the software and hardware on the robot in this repository. [Contanct information](#Link-tree) will be left below, so feel free to reach out! Due to lack of resources, 1991 will only be competing in two events this year. We will be hosting with team 181, Birds of Prey, in [Hartford](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2024cthar) and attending [Waterbury](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2024ctwat).

## Season timeline
Starting at kickoff our team has been diligent in documenting our season in an engineering notebook. Everyday we take attendance of students and mentors, take notes on what happened that day, and action items to finish. The engineering notebook acts almost like a git history, with each day being another commit. It's available for view in google docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYIvurchCGXITy4c3Y5kDGU6yW_Gognxy2Y8CyMoIX4/edit).
